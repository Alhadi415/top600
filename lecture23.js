Numerous causes include parasitic, idiopathic, drug hypersensitivity, vasculitis-like Churg-strauss, acute necrotizing-unknown etiology. Cardiac disease can occur in 50% of idiopathic (absolute eosinophilic count 1.5 x 10^9 / L). Myocardial infiltrate, perivascular or interstitial, associated with necrosis is seen. Diagnostic tests include echo, CMR, biopsy, and bone marrow biopsy. Steroids, immunosuppressive therapy, inotropes, and circulatory support are the mainstay of therapy.",
