{
    "question": "The cause of dyspnea in this patient is likely to be due to:",
    "options": [
        "A. Left heart failure",
        "B. Primary pulmonary hypertension",
        "C. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder",
        "D. None of the above"
    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_1q.JPG",
    "answer": "A. Left heart failure",
    "explanation": "The mitral inflow shown here is indicative of high left atrial (LA) pressure. Although the patient is in atrial fibrillation with only E-wave, the E-wave deceleration is very rapid, with a deceleration time of 100 ms."

// Question 322
{
    "question": "This is an end systolic frame in a patient with shortness of breath. The most likely diagnosis is:",
    "options": [
        "A. Ebstein’s anomaly",
        "B. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
        "C. Atrial septal defect",

    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_2q.JPG",
    "answer": "D. Dilated cardiomyopathy",
    "explanation": "There is a four-chamber dilatation. There is no increase in wall thickness to suggest HOCM. In atrial septal defect, both the right ventricle and the right atrium will be dilated due to volume overload with normal LA and LV size. The tricuspid valve position is normal and hence does not support the diagnosis of Ebstein’s anomaly."

{
    "question": "The most likely mechanism of mitral regurgitation (MR) in this patient is:",
    "options": [
        "A. P2 tethering",
        "B. P2 prolapse",
        "C. Bileaflet mitral valve prolapse",

    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_3q.JPG",
    "answer": "A. P2 tethering",
    "explanation": "This is an apical long-axis view, showing A2 and P2 scallops of the mitral valve. The MR jet is directed posterolaterally toward P2, consistent with P2 tethering. A similar jet direction can also occur in A2 prolapse, but both leaflets coapt distal to the plane of mitral annulus. Bileaflet prolapse of equal magnitude will result in a central jet."

    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_6q.JPG",
    "answer": "A. Right coronary artery (RCA)",
    "explanation": "This is the classical location of the RCA. The LCA is not seen in the aortic long-axis view. Because of its left lateral location, it is seen in the short-axis view. There is no aortic dissection and entry tear into dissection would be a hole in the endothelium and is not tubular in shape."

    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_7q.JPG",
    "answer": "A. Coarctation of the aorta",
    "explanation": "Narrowing and turbulence at the junction of the arch and descending aorta are clearly seen, indicative of coarctation. In severe AR, flow reversal is holodiastolic. This is a systolic frame (see marker on the ECG). There is no communication between the aorta and the pulmonary artery, suggestive of PDA."

    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_8q.JPG",
    "answer": "A. Right pulmonary artery (RPA)",
    "explanation": "This is a TEE image from the proximal esophageal location, a high basal view above the level of the left atrium. Also note the linear shadows in the RPA, which are commonly seen and represent mirror image artifacts. A short-axis image of the RPA or color flow image at a low scale would confirm this. The large circular structure is the ascending aorta and number 1 is the SVC in cross-section. Also note the reverberations from a catheter in the SVC."

        "D. Postmyectomy of HOCM"
    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_30q.JPG",
    "answer": "B. Postinfarction posterior VSD",
    "explanation": "There is marked thinning of the midinferior wall and inferior septum without any scarring. There is also a defect establishing communication between the LV and the RV and the color flow confirms this. This is classical postinfarct posterior VSD, and a short-axis view of the LV at all levels would help to delineate the pathology. Such thinning does not occur in congenital VSD. The location of iatrogenic infarct or myectomy in HOCM is in the proximal anterior septum."

    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_31q.JPG",
    "answer": "A. Bicuspid aortic valve",
    "explanation": "This is a classic bicuspid aortic valve. Although a dissection flap in a patient with circumferential dissection with a central true lumen may mimic this, both leaflets and commissures are clearly seen here. This image is at the level of the aortic annulus and the rest of the ascending aorta is not shown to comment about nondissecting aortic aneurysm."

// Question 332
{
    "question": "Mitral regurgitation (MR) signal shown here is suggestive of:",
    "options": [
        "A. Some diastolic MR in addition to systolic MR",
        "B. Markedly depressed left ventricular (LV) dp/dt",
        "C. Both",
        "D. Neither"
    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_32q.JPG",
    "answer": "C. Both",
    "explanation": "The initial portion of the signal at low velocity represents diastolic MR, which occurs during left atrial relaxation and may be due to a long PR interval or high left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP). The rate of velocity rise of the MR signal is very slow. The normal time taken for the MR velocity to increase from 1 to 3 m/s is 10–20 ms, representing an LV dp/dt of 1600–3200 mmHg/s. In this example, this interval is 160 ms, giving an average rate of pressure rise during early systole (loosely called LV dp/dt and correlates with this) is 200 mmHg/s. Also note the very prolonged QRS duration. The main determinants of LV dp/dt include LV contractility, heart rate, preload, and LV systolic synchrony, which would be abnormal in left bundle branch block."

        "C. Pseudonormal pattern",
        "D. Restrictive pattern"
    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_33q.JPG",
    "answer": "B. Abnormal relaxation",
    "explanation": "Suggested by an E/A ratio of <1. Although the E-wave deceleration time is <250 ms, generally the isovolumic relaxation time (not shown here) tends to be greater than 100 ms. The E/A ratio can be lower in the elderly because of age-related LV relaxation failure, patients with low filling pressures, more rapid heart rates, and those with prolongation of the PR interval. In a pseudonormal pattern, the mitral inflow looks normal, but there is some other evidence of LV relaxation abnormality, such as reduced Em velocity, reduced mitral flow propagation, or increased duration of atrial systole as judged by pulmonary vein flow (AR wave reversal duration). Restrictive pattern is characterized by an E/A ratio of >2, E-wave deceleration of <150 ms, and isovolumic relaxation time duration of <70 ms."

    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_34q.JPG",
    "answer": "C. Aortic regurgitation",
    "explanation": "Note the diastolic frame showing an AR jet. The AR is severe as the width of the jet is >60% of the left ventricular outflow tract and has a large vena contracta and PISA."

    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_35q.JPG" ,
    "answer": "A. AS and AR",
    "explanation": "Unlike the MR signal, the AS signal occupies only the ejection period and is absent during the isovolumic contraction time. Hence, the signal starts a few milliseconds after the QRS. The diastolic velocity is too high for MS. This order of gradient and LA pressure would be incompatible with life. VSD flow is predominantly systolic with a presystolic component caused by atrial contraction. The gradient across a coarctation is systolic, the duration increases with greater degrees of stenosis, and there may be a diastolic gradient. However, both the systolic and diastolic components will be in the same direction."

// Question 337
{
    "question": "This is a TEE image from the midesophagus of a late diastolic frame of the aortic valve. This patient is most likely to have:",
    "options": [
        "A. Severe aortic regurgitation",
        "B. Severe aortic stenosis",
        "C. HOCM",
        "D. Ascending aortic dissection"
    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_37q.JPG",
    "answer": "A. Severe aortic regurgitation",
    "explanation": "The aortic leaflets are thickened with rolled-up edges and a central coaptation defect in end diastole. This anatomy would be associated with wide-open aortic regurgitation, as the regurgitant orifice is visible by anatomic imaging. Aortic stenosis cannot be diagnosed by a diastolic frame. HOCM typically causes midsystolic closure of the aortic valve, best visualized by M mode. Aortic dissection may cause AR by one of several mechanisms: dilatation of sino–tubular junction, leaflet tethering, extension of hematoma into the aortic leaflet causing it to prolapse, or as a result of the primary problem such as bicuspid aortic valve or annulo-aortic ectasia."
},

// Question 338
{
    "question": "This patient is most likely to have:",
    "options": [
        "A. Acute severe MR",
        "B. Chronic severe MR",
        "C. Severe MS and mild MR",
        "D. None of the above"
    ], "questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_38q.JPG",
    "answer": "B. Chronic severe MR",
    "explanation": "The MR signal density is more than 60% of the mitral inflow signal. This correlates with a volume of regurgitation. In addition, the mitral inflow velocity is increased without a slow deceleration. A slow deceleration would indicate significant mitral stenosis. Despite severe MR, the profile of the MR signal is quite rounded without the rapid deceleration that would typically be seen in acute severe MR, because of the large left atrial V-wave, the so-called “V-wave cutoff sign.” Note that the heart rate is 151 beats per minute. At rapid heart rates, MR may be grossly underestimated by color Doppler due to limited temporal resolution and continuous wave Doppler is very helpful."

    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_39q.JPG",
    "answer": "A. Central venous catheter-associated infection",
    "explanation": "This bicaval transesophageal view shows a large mass in the superior vena cava, which is typically associated with a central catheter-associated thrombus or vegetation. This most likely is the cause of his sepsis and endocarditis. In addition, there is a possible defect at the superior portion of the fossa ovalis, suggesting a patent foramen ovale (PFO). This patient had a large PFO by color and contrast echocardiography, allowing paradoxical embolization of the bacterial mass to cause left-sided endocarditis, escaping the protective filtration mechanism offered by the lung."

    ],"questionImage": "https://alhadi415.github.io/top600/images/17_40q.JPG",
    "answer": "A. Aortic valve vegetation",
    "explanation": "The mass on the aortic valve is suggestive of mass on the left ventricular side of the aortic valve. This is suggestive of vegetation. Also, there is prolapse of the noncoronary cusp, causing significant AR, and this is due to leaflet destruction with endocarditis. The other mechanism for prolapse could be a bicuspid aortic valve with prolapse of the larger cusp. Node of Arantius, as the name suggests, is a nodular thickening of the central portion of the leaflet edge and is best visualized from the short-axis view of the valve. Lambl’s excrescences are thin filamentous structures attached to the leaflet margin. There is no evidence of aortic dissection or intramural hematoma in this patient."
